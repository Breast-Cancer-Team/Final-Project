2/28/2021 Meeting:
•	Test, Train Split
o	    Use same random seed for splits or save data to two csv files so train and test splits are the same for each model

•	Ensemble:
    o	Final ensemble in scikit learn with classifiers scikitlearn.ensemble.votingclassifier
    o	Ask Dave about ensemble - can a heterogeneous model use different features for each base model? 
    	Initial assumption: Maximize accuracy of each model and then use an ensemble at the end. Each base model has 1 vote for output, therefore the input features of each model can be different?

•	Interface for our program
    o	In terminal what numbers do you have and then we can build a dataframe for them and our program will run and display an output? Or fxn outside of ensemble that reads in a dataframe and put into our program.

•	How to unit test this? 

•	From Prof. Valleau on classifying / determining efficacy of models
    o	Feature selection using Python for classification problems | by Richard Liang | Towards Data Science
    o	F1, etc. better for understanding if model is doing well or not as opposed to accuracy of the model
    o	Need to look at histograms
    	Could look at residuals for booleans 0, 1, -1
    	Also ask about histogram
•	Action Items:
    o	Go through classifiers 
    o	MSE test for already made models
    o	Decision tree stuff 
    o	Clarify questions for Monday
    •	Anaconda navigator for confused beginners like me.

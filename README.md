### Machine Learning Ensemble To Determine Tumor Benign or Malignant Status 

## Introduction
Welcome to our open source ensemble! This program is optimized to predict malignant or benign status of a tumor given quatitative measurements of the tumor cells nucleii.
 The intended users for this function are pathologists who have fine needle aspirations of breast cancer tumors. 

## The Motivation
The motivation behind this software is to attempt to increase relaibility of pathologist's Malignant/Benign designation, as the current accuracy is only about 80%(Sangha B, et al. CAR Journal. 2016. 67(3):284-9).
We thought that given the quantitative measurements that pathologists gather about the tumor's nucleii, we could predict (with better accuracy) the tumors status with an enemble model.
The reason we chose an ensemble approach is to have a "voting approach" approach to the issue, the most common output from each of our weak learners will be included as the ensemble's designation.

## Screenshots of Code

## Tech/Framework Used
   Built with:
     - Jupyter Notebook
     - Sublime Text

## Features:
     - command line accessible calling capabilities
     - All ML algortihms used, saved as .py files
     - a wrapping function that acquires the data from the user and outputs a prediction to the command line.
     - a data splitting function that takes the users input data and cleans+pasrses it. 
 
## Use Cases: 
User: Pathologist examining fine needle aspirations of breast cancer tissue under a microscope for malignancy status.

Information Necessary:
- 'radius_mean',
- 'texture_mean',
- 'perimeter_mean',
- 'area_mean',
- 'smoothness_mean',
- 'compactness_mean',
- 'concavity_mean',
- 'concave points_mean',
- 'symmetry_mean',
- 'fractal_dimension_mean'

Responses: 
- Boolean of malignant or benign nature of tumor based on input information.
- Plot of data and predicted accuracy values.
  
Messages: 
- Dimensions out of bounds.
- Not enough information provided.
- Incorrect File Type.

## Contributing Guidline
    If you would like to contribute to this project, areas in which more contribution would be welcome is in the generations of additional weak learners to add to the voting population.
Additionally, a graphic user interface for the pathologists to easily access the program would also be helpful. The current documentation is PEP8 compliant and worked out of the GitHub Repository listed below.
